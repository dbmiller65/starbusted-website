# Starbusted.com

A modern, responsive website dedicated to exposing coffee cup litterbugs one Starbucks cup at a time.

## Project Overview

Starbusted is a community-driven website that aims to reduce littering by exposing coffee cup litterbugs. When someone leaves their Starbucks cup behind, their name is right there on it - and now, so is their photo on our website. The site features a clean, modern design with a color scheme inspired by the famous coffee chain.

## Features

- Responsive design that works on all devices
- Coffee-themed UI with animations
- Gallery of busted litterbugs with their coffee cups
- Photo upload functionality for submissions
- Contact form for visitor inquiries
- Smooth scrolling navigation
